    <string name="story_scroll_view">\tIf you read to this, it means that Dr. Strange story finished good and i understood why he didn\'t want to tell me how exactly it will finish.\n\n
        When we prepared to fight Thanos, i was aware that your 30 anniversary is soon. Some thoughts in my mind told me i need to prepare for that.\n\n
        While Avengers were busy planning the last battle, i used the Infinity Stones to hide the stash in secure place. \n\n
        As you might understand by this moment i want you to collect all of them to receive the ultimate stash. I left you small hints to
        every single stone how they should be collected in your reality.\n\n
        All of the data how to collect them is hidden is this phone.\n
        On purpose network connection is of, in case somebody might want to track you.\n
        Some of task are more challenging. That was the only way to be sure non other person will collect things which are waiting for you.\n\n
        You got chance to take them all back.\n\n
        So, will you do it? \n\n
